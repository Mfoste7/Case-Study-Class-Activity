### Robinhood - Democratizing Investing

Robinhood is the company that you may have heard about while overhearing your aunt complain about how your cousin stole her credit card and lost their savings and then some while executing complex options trades on margin. 

Robinhood was founded in April 2013 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. The rest is history.
